# Structural-Hormesis-in-Protein-Aggregation

The repository contains the core three Python scripts used for the numerical simulations of paper:

Abhishek Mallela, Santiago Schnell (2025) Structural hormesis in protein aggregation: A minimal mechanistic model *bioRxiv*

The scrips are not well-commented; this will be done in the future.
